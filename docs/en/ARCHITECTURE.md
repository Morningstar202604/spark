## Overview

Spark is a **local-first AI coding agent**: a Codex-style ReAct loop over an
OpenAI-compatible LLM, with a four-level sandbox, human approval gates,
checkpoint/rollback, long-term memory, and a browser UI served from the same
process.

```
user input → AgentLoop (turn engine) → model call → tool execution → feedback → next round
                   ↑                                                  ↓
        context compaction ← memory retrieval ← AGENTS.md ←── SQLite persistence
                   ↓
        SSE streaming → Web UI (React) / TUI (Textual) / Desktop (pywebview)
```

## Core components

### 1. Agent loop (`src/spark/core/loop.py`)

`AgentLoop` drives one turn: build messages → stream the model → on tool calls
sandbox-check + approval-gate + execute → append results → repeat until the
model answers. Guards on the way:

| Guard | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Repeat-call circuit breaker (same tool+args fingerprint) | `_record_call` |
| Per-turn token budget | `_charge_tokens` / `_budget_exceeded` |
| Auto-compaction past the context threshold | `_maybe_compact` (turn-boundary-safe cut) |
| Incremental usage cache (prompt/history/tool schemas) | `_usage` |
| Hook events (`app_start`, `pre_tool`, …) | `_notify_safe` |

A LangGraph state-machine path (`graph.py`) formalises the same
call-model → execute-tools cycle with interrupt-based approval; `loop.py`
remains the outer orchestrator either way.

### 2. Context engine (`src/spark/core/context.py`)

Builds what the model actually sees: system prompt (`prompts/system.md`) +
workdir + detected environment block (real runtimes probed once per process) +
access-mode hint + `<available_skills>`; then AGENTS.md, the memory block, and
the token-budgeted recent history (images collapsed to placeholders except the
newest). `history_token_usage` shares the exact same prompt builder so the
usage meter can never drift from the real request.

### 3. Compaction (`src/spark/core/compact.py`)

When usage crosses `context.compact_threshold`, old turns are folded into a
structured 5-section summary (Objective / Important Details / Work State /
Next Move / Relevant Files). Prior summaries are merged by rules (new wins on
conflict, Active→Completed moves, file lists union). Falls back to
LlamaIndex's `ChatSummaryMemoryBuffer` when the direct LLM call fails.

### 4. Providers (`src/spark/providers/`)

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `base.py` | `Provider` protocol: `async stream(messages, tools)` |
| `factory.py` | `create_provider(cfg)` — `openai_compat` / `ollama` / `mock` |
| `openai_compat.py` | One LiteLLM-backed implementation serving both `OpenAICompatProvider` and `OllamaProvider`: streaming, retry with backoff, reasoning-content passthrough, incremental tool-call aggregation, `<think>` splitting |
| `mock.py` | Deterministic provider for tests |
| `probe.py` | Connectivity probe used by `spark test` / Settings → Test |

### 5. Tool registry (`src/spark/tools/registry.py`)

All tools are registered as JSON schemas and dispatched through a table, so
approval and sandbox checks are uniform:

```
ToolRegistry
├── fs:        read_file, write_file, apply_patch, list_dir
├── search:    grep, glob
├── shell:     run_shell (+ bg_start / bg_output / bg_kill, persisted across restarts)
├── git:       git_status / diff / log / branch / add / commit, run_tests
├── worktree:  worktree_list / create / remove
├── notebook:  read_notebook, notebook_edit
├── web:       web_search (Bing), web_fetch (SSRF-guarded)
├── planning:  update_plan, load_skill
├── agents:    task (sub-agent delegation, up to 4 parallel)
└── mcp__:     dynamic tools bridged by McpBridge (official MCP SDK)
```

Stale MCP tools (server restarted with fewer tools) are rejected by name via
the registry's schema revision.

### 6. Sandbox & policy (`src/spark/sandbox.py`, `src/spark/policy.py`)

Four access levels, progressively unlocked:

```
sandbox-only:   read/search/plan only
workspace:      + write/patch/shell inside the workdir
full-access:    + operate outside the workdir (protected paths still blocked)
unrestricted:   everything (Spark's own code protection included off)
```

- Command deny-list scanning + workdir path-escape checks (`sandbox.py`)
- Tool classification: READONLY / WRITE / SHELL / EXECUTE sets (`policy.py`);
  shell-class tools can never receive a persistent "always allow"
- Wildcard permission rules with per-(tool, args-signature) session grants

### 7. Web layer (`src/spark/web/`)

stdlib `http.server` — no web framework:

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `server.py` | Entry point; builds `SparkHTTPServer` + `SparkWebState` |
| `routes.py` | Handler class: security guards (loopback/host/origin/CSRF/token) + GET routes + POST dispatch table |
| `_handlers.py` | Standalone POST handlers (models/agents_md/memory/sessions/checkpoints/chat/settings/test) |
| `sse.py` | SSE session: text coalescing, heartbeat, backpressure queue, disconnect-cancels-turn |
| `state.py` | `SparkWebState`: config, loop lifecycle, approver bridge, MCP boot, memory |
| `utils.py` / `_httpbase.py` / `_routing.py` | Shared helpers |

Auth: loopback is token-free; remote callers need the `X-Spark-Token` header
(token generated at startup, never logged). Non-local Host header or a
cross-origin Origin header is rejected.

### 8. Persistence (`src/spark/store.py`)

SQLite (WAL) with combined indexes:

| Table | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `sessions` | Session meta (id, title, model, workdir, timestamps) |
| `messages` | Chat messages (role, content, tool payload) |
| `tool_events` | Audit trail per tool call (name, args, duration, ok) |
| `checkpoints` | Checkpoint records |
| `bg_jobs` | Background job state (survives restarts) |

### 9. Memory (`src/spark/memory/`)

`store.py` (ChromaDB vectors + SQLite rows, CAS version checks),
`extractor.py` (LLM fact extraction, secret redaction, consolidation),
`service.py` (add/search/optimize, degrade-to-keyword when embeddings fail).

### 10. Checkpoints (`src/spark/core/checkpoints.py`)

After every write/shell turn, an incremental `tar.gz` snapshot (baseline +
delta) lands under `~/.spark/checkpoints/`. Rollback restores the workdir
files (and deletes files created since) plus the conversation history.

## Frontend (`web/src/`)

React 19 + Zustand + Vite + Tailwind 4.

- `App.tsx` — layout, history rendering, checkpoint dialog
- `api.ts` — REST + SSE client (`fetchWithTimeout`, stream reader)
- `store/` — `chatStore` (stream state machine), `sessionStore`, `uiStore`
- `components/` — ChatMessage (Markdown + highlight.js), ApprovalCard,
  PlanCard, ContextMeter, ThinkingBlock, SessionSidebar, SettingsPanel…
- i18n (`i18n.ts`) — zh/en, persisted per client

Bundles are split (react / markdown / highlight / settings chunks) and built
into `src/spark/web/dist`, which ships inside the wheel so `pip install` works
without Node.

## CLI (`src/spark/cli.py`, Typer)

```
spark                # interactive TUI (textual)
spark exec "prompt"  # headless one-shot
spark web            # serve the web UI on 127.0.0.1
spark desktop        # pywebview shell around the same server (Windows WebView2)
spark test --model X # connectivity probe
spark sessions / resume <id>
spark init / doctor / version / config show|set|path
```

## Extension guide

### Add a tool

1. Implement it under `src/spark/tools/` (pydantic Args model → `ToolResult`)
2. Register the schema in `registry.py` (`schemas()` + `_build_dispatch_table()`)
3. Classify it in `policy.py` (READONLY / WRITE / SHELL / EXECUTE)
4. Add tests

### Add a provider

1. Implement the `Provider` protocol (`stream()` async generator) — or reuse
   the LiteLLM layer in `openai_compat.py`
2. Wire it in `providers/factory.py::create_provider`
3. Extend `ProviderName` in `config.py` and the Settings panel options

## Design principles

- **Local-first**: code, keys, conversation, memory never leave the machine
- **Boring web stack**: stdlib HTTP server + SSE; no framework to pin
- **Layered safety**: sandbox levels → approval policy → protected paths →
  egress sanitization (`sanitize.py`)
- **Observable**: token accounting, context meter, tool audit events
- **Fail-soft**: memory degrades to keywords, probes degrade gracefully,
  compaction falls back across two paths
