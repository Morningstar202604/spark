"""Process-wide agent runtime: one event loop, one owner thread.

Why this exists
---------------
Several long-lived resources are bound to the event loop that created them:

* ``aiosqlite`` connections (behind LangGraph's ``AsyncSqliteSaver``) create
  futures on their constructing loop;
* the official MCP SDK enters ``anyio`` cancel scopes that must be exited from
  the same task that entered them;
* LiteLLM's async client caches an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` per loop.

The web server used to call ``AgentLoop.iter_turn_sync``, which built a *new*
event loop for every turn.  That made a persistent SQLite turn checkpointer
structurally impossible (``Future attached to a different loop``), so crash
recovery silently ran on ``MemorySaver`` and died with the process.

``AgentRuntime`` owns a single daemon thread running one loop forever.  Every
surface that wants durable turn state drives its turns through this runtime:

* the HTTP server (thread per request) uses :meth:`iterate` (blocking iterator);
* the Textual TUI (its own asyncio loop) uses :meth:`iterate_async`;
* ``spark exec`` / ACP use :meth:`run` or :meth:`iterate_async`.

Turns stay serialized per session by the caller's own lock — this module only
provides the loop, not concurrency control.
